Java-based Battle Game


Developed and extended a modular Java-based battle game, demonstrating strong object-oriented programming principles with classes such as Character, Spell, and BattleGame. Implemented core game mechanics including character attributes, combat, and spell casting, while adhering to a clear separation of concerns. Designed and implemented algorithms for game logic, including damage calculations and spell success determination, utilizing Java libraries (e.g., java.io, java.util.Random, java.util.Scanner) for file I/O operations (FileReader, BufferedReader, FileWriter, and BufferedWriter) and data management with ArrayList. Managed file handling with exception handling for FileNotFoundException and IOException. Refactored and expanded the Character class to incorporate spell capabilities.
